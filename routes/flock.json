This pod is entered in the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition to perform full systems tests on SpaceXâ€™s one mile long test track at high-speeds and in a vacuum.",

This is made possible by introducing a geodetic diagrid frame which is designed to accept the applied forces better than a standard rectilinear frame. Although this style of framing has traditionally been considered more difficult to manufacture, this is quickly overcome with modern technology by precision modelling of the entire assembly in 3D, and the use of rapid fabrication technology including laser cutting and 3D printing."],

Although air caster technology has been in use for decades and is well understood, our levitation system is the first of its kind."

This arrangement doubles the magnetic strength on one side and cancels it out on the other. Braking force is achieved by exploiting the same drag produced in magnetic levitation - or when a permanent magnet is dropped down a copper tube. As the permanent magnets approach the I-beam while the pod is in motion, tiny circular electrical currents called eddy currents are induced within the beam which smoothly slows the pod down in a highly controlled fashion.
