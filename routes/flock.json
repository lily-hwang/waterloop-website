This arrangement doubles the magnetic strength on one side and cancels it out on the other. Braking force is achieved by exploiting the same drag produced in magnetic levitation - or when a permanent magnet is dropped down a copper tube. As the permanent magnets approach the I-beam while the pod is in motion, tiny circular electrical currents called eddy currents are induced within the beam which smoothly slows the pod down in a highly controlled fashion.
